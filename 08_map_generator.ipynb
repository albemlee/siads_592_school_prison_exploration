    "\n",
    "In exploring the Vera Institute's incarceration data, it made sense to start at the beginning. Using the map generator to look at incarceration rates in **1970** (the first year of available data), we see that only Georgia has any data at all (**MAP 1**). What does this mean? One way to interpret it is that Georgia was home to the vast majority of incarcerated Americans in 1970. Alternatively, one might note that perhaps Georgia started collecting incarceration data relatively early. The correct interpretation might be a mix of both. Perhaps Georgia was at the vanguard of data collection regarding prisoners in part due to it's extensive incarceration aparatus. After all, social science data collection is never independent from realities of political economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This relatively early incarceration data from Georgia suggests that one must look beyond the data and investigate the history that could have generated such data in the first place. A quick Google search makes it clear that Georgia was indeed at the vanguard of data collection--for frightful reasons. Although the Thirteenth Amendment abolished American slavery, the language included one exception - forced labor was banned \"except as a punishment for crime\". The Reconstruction-era South was quick to latch onto this wording as a means to re-enslave the recently emancipated Black population. This new penchant for convict leasing meant that the exploitation of Black Americans thus began to take on a new form--mass incarceration. According to the 'Wikipedia' page on convict leasing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_leasing), Georgia was the first to begin the large-scale re-enslavement of Black Americans: \"In Georgia convict leasing began in April 1868, when Union General and newly appointed provisional governor Thomas H. Ruger issued a convict lease for prisoners to William Fort for work on the Georgia and Alabama Railroad. The contract specified \"one hundred able bodied and healthy Negro convicts\" in return for a fee to the state of $2500.\" Given the early beginning's of Georgia's carceral state, it's unsurprising that Georgia was already engaging in robust data collection by 1970. Prisoners were assets after all.   \n",

With respect to prisons, it is well-documented that prisoners are frequently moved from high-density counties to low-density counties. This pattern isn't immediately visible in the data. In order to examine this trend via mapping techniques, one must be creative with the data. As such, a new column was created in the data frame ('black_prison_ration') which calculated the ratio of the incarcerated Black population to the overall Black population (aged 15-64). Though analytically imperfect, this new column reveals a pattern whereby Black residents as a percentage of the population are being incarcerated at extremely high rates (often more than 10%) in some counties.

    "The usage of mapping techniques to visualize the Vera Institute's incarceration trends data proved to be an effective technique for the historical analysis of mass incarceration in America. The very presence of thorough data in Georgia going back to 1970 indicated a large-scale incarceration apparatus was already being operated in that state. A review of the history of the Jim Crow South indicates that Georgia began the trend of 'convict leasing'--a widespread practice used to re-enslave Black Americans after the 13th amendment allowed for a labor-as-punishment loophole.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we watch incarceration rates skyrocket across America from the 1980s onwards, it becomes clear that the numbers reflect changes in federal policy as the Nixon administration began a tough-on-crime political culture that flourished during the Reagan years and was left unchallenged until relatively recently. Given that the modern prison system emerged from the 'convict leasing' system that began in Georgia, it is unsurprising that the trends toward mass incarceration began in the Deep South before spreading throughout the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the use of map data allowed us to visualize the extent to which Black Americans are displaced from high-density counties to low-density counties--a pattern that was not replicated for White Americans. This pattern further indicates the extent to which Black Americans have been targeted by mass incarceration, as well as the extent to which geographically bound data analysis has its shortcomings. Given that the of relationship between social inputs (e.g. education spending) and social outcomes (e.g. incarceration status) is not necessarily bound by geography, it may not be justifiable to dwell on statistical relationships that hinge on geograpic location (e.g. county). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the usage of mapping techniques allowed for a rapid evaluation of the quality of the Vera Institute Data Set. Although substantial, this data set has significant gaps which would undermine any statistical relationships that might be gleaned from a large-n analysis. For instance, data from Illinois are often missing from the data set. Given the state's complex history of race and mass incarceration, its exclusion suggests that any statistical correlations discovered in the data set should be taken with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, the data largely bear out the documented history of an incarceration apparatus that targets Black Americans. This is a mass tragedy that will force American society to contemplate the meaning of 'justice' for generations to come."
